        <h3 class="">The Origins</h3>
        <h4 class="col-7 mx-5 fs-5">BusIt had its humble beginnings as a school project requirement by two students: “MJ” Mark Joseph Espiritu and “Jian” Justin Ira Natividad.  MJ, who lived in Iriga City, had to take the bus every day to get to AdNU (Roughly 32km!). As a frequent commuter, he noticed that knowledge on the bus schedule was necessary in planning trips – knowledge not readily available everywhere. This is when the idea of BusIt was born. Now he, along with his classmate and partner-in-crime Jian, hope to revolutionize the bus system in Bicol, one device at a time.
